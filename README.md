ExpressionEvaluator
===================

Exploratory project demonstrating custom query parser in Java.
This is a port of QueryParser (https://github.com/jmht/QueryParser)
from C# to Java, replacing the originally hand-crafted parser with 
Antlr (http://www.antlr.org/) and the .NET Expression Tree 
evaluation with a Java implementation.

The basic motivation remains the same - to explore the option
of a dynamic query capability in a service.
